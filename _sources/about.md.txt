Hi there, I'm Daniel.

I am a Data Scientist based in Singapore, currently working @[OCBC AI Labs](https://www.ocbc.com/group/careers/) where we deliver a variety of AI applications for banking use cases. Prior to banking, I worked in the Optimization team @[TripAdvisor](https://careers.tripadvisor.com/).
