# Hello World

Brand new year, brand new blog!

Hello, my name is Daniel. I've embarked and committed to on a couple important projects and decisions this year, and I thought it would be a good opportunity to start blogging. This year:

## I'm planning to write more and [show my work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18290401-show-your-work). 
In 2020, a snap decision to share my story online [led me to my current team](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ddanieltan_ocbc-bank-posted-on-linkedin-activity-6682138292223381504-ENZA), and that entire process opened my eyes to the importance of being able to communicate a story through writing. More than ever, I'm convinced of the importance of practising writing. Not to mention, I had an interesting experience navigating data science interviews in a post-covid world and I have many thoughts and tips that I would like to blog about.

## I'm starting the [Georgia Tech OMSCS programme](https://omscs.gatech.edu/). 
I have long heard many positive reviews about this Masters programme and decided to take the plunge this year. My goal is to build up my computer science skills to make me a more well-rounded data scientist. I expect that I'll have plenty to blog about the OMSCS programme, as well as, thoughts on specific courses as I go through them. 

## I discovered the [Executable Book Project](https://executablebooks.org/)
EBP's tools have inspired me to explore website building! Their many projects, such as [MyST-NB](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-NB) and [jupyter-book](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book), allow me to use the data science tools I'm familiar with, to create front-end websites (which I'm thoroughly *unfamiliar* with). I  believe the textbooks of our future generations will be primarily written as executable books, and I'm eager to use this blog to practise writing using these tools.

So that's my plan for 2021! Hope I'll be able to generate some interesting and valuable content for you. ðŸ˜„
