It has it's own [wikepedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_math) and publishers have successfully [sold](https://www.amazon.sg/Singapore-Model-Method-Learning-Mathematics/dp/B0033HXD1K) [many](https://www.amazon.sg/Step-Step-Model-Drawing-Singapore/dp/1934026964/) [books](https://www.amazon.sg/Math-Focus-Singapore-Professional-Development/dp/9810168683/) teaching the Singapore Math Method internationally.

    "Beyond being a gentle entry to Algebra, I believe the Singapore Math Model works because it also provided a framework for problem solving. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, it provided a framework for students to:\n",
    "- Take some time to plan how to approach a problem, before diving head in\n",
    "- Summarize the key details of a problem into simpler abstractions (eg. word problems into bar model diagrams) \n",
    "- And allow themselves to interact with these abstractions to discover the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps (more generally referred to as **Data Modeling**) is what I like best about the Singapore Math Model method. These are universaly principles I still fall back on when approaching any coding problem. While there are many tools in Python (eg. Classes, dataclasses) that offer convenient ways to implement Data Modelling, my favourite is to use NamedTuples from the [typing library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)."

    "- **Trees**, which is what our skiier would potentially collide with. Each tree is made up of a set of x and y point co-ordinate.\n",
    "- **The Map**, which is made up of a snapshot of where trees are. This snapshot is of a specific height and width and we are told that the pattern of trees cyclically repeats itself both horizontally and vertically.\n",
    "- **The Path**, which is made of the number of steps to the right and to the bottom which our skiier takes. The problem will throw different paths at us, and we're expected to always calculate how many trees our skiier collides with."
